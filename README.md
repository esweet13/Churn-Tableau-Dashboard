# Churn-Tableau-Dashboard

INTRODUCTION

The data analyst’s job does not end once the data has been analyzed. A vital skill for data analysts is to represent and report the data to stakeholders. In this task, you will demonstrate your ability to identify actionable insights from data and communicate them using effective storytelling methods.

This task consists of three parts:
In part 1, you will use Tableau to create an interactive data dashboard to support executive decision-making. Your dashboard should enable leaders to explore the data, identify trends, and compare key metrics. Your dashboard will feature a variety of interactive reports and data representations and will be accessible to individuals with colorblindness.

Your dashboard will integrate data from two sources:

1. Provided data set: You will select one of the data sets and associated data dictionaries from the following link:

D210 Data Sets and Associated Data Dictionaries

It is recommended, but not required, that you choose the same data set that you used for your performance assessments in previous courses. Review the data dictionary that is relevant to your chosen data set for additional details about the audience.

2. Additional data set: You will identify an external, public data set as an additional data set for your dashboard. This data set should contain data and variables that complement the data set you chose from the provided options and should enhance the insights you can gain from the provided data set. Recommended sources include U.S. Census data, Kaggle, or other public data repositories. You are responsible for ensuring that you have the rights to use the data set.

In part 2, you will give a simulated presentation to a panel of peers. You will identify actionable insights from the data and communicate these insights to a technical audience using effective storytelling methods. In your presentation, you should employ tactics to engage the audience and ensure that a meaningful message has been delivered.

In part 3, you will write a reflection paper to demonstrate your understanding of the techniques and value of data representation and reporting.

Refer to the data dictionary for your chosen provided data set for additional background information about the audience of your data representations.

Part 1: Interactive Data Dashboard

A. Provide a copy of your interactive Tableau dashboard to support executive decision-making. Your dashboard must be accessible to users with colorblindness, and must include the components
in each of the following bullet points:
• data integrated from both chosen data sets
• four different data representations to summarize the data or display trends
• two different interactive controls that allow the user to modify the presentation of data
• two different metrics or key performance indicators computed using data from both chosen data sets 1. Provide both data sets that serve as the data source for the dashboard.
2. Provide step-by-step instructions to guide users through the dashboard installation.
3. Provide instructions to help users navigate the dashboard.

Part 2: Reflection Paper
C. Write a reflection paper to demonstrate your understanding of data representation and reporting by doing the following:
1. Explain how the purpose and function of your dashboard align with the needs outlined in the data
dictionary associated with your chosen data set.
2. Explain how the variables in the additional data set enhance the insights that can be drawn from the
data set you chose from the provided options.
3. Explain two different data representations from your dashboard and how executive leaders can use
them to support decision-making.
4. Explain two interactive controls in your dashboard and how each enables the user to modify the
presentation of the data.
5. Describe how you built your dashboard to be accessible for individuals with colorblindness.
6. Explain how two data representations in your presentation support the story you wanted to tell. 7. Explain how you used audience analysis to adapt the message in your presentation.
8. Describe how you designed your presentation for universal access by all audiences.
9. Explain two elements of effective storytelling that you implemented in your presentation and how
each element was intended to engage the audience.
